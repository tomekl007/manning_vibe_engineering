## Continuous AI: Craft Your Own “Pair-Programming with Agent” Style

Forget generic “ask‑the‑chatbot” routines—this chapter shows how to blend Language Server hooks (LSP), Model‑Control Protocols (MCP), and deep context packs (Context7 or your own recipe) into a personal, always‑on coding partner. We map the autonomy ladder - Chat → Editor → Full Agent  - and show how to tune feedback loops, tame noise, and let the bot handle yak‑shave while you steer architecture. Reviews and decisions stay human, but first‑pass diffs, debug digs, and docs? Your agent’s can help a lot.

### Check the Vibe
If your “AI helper” still lives in a chat tab, you’re leaving velocity on the table - wire it into the editor or it’s just a fancy clipboard.

### Street Rule
Tool ≠ process. Shape the agent to your workflow, not the other way around. Customize, or you will lose 

### Move to Make
Pick one repo and tune the toolchain - enable LSP‑powered and the useful MCP servers (but not too much!), and documentation prompt packs. Work a full day with retries capped at two - note speed gains and noise. Iterate tomorrow.
